# SimpleDockerImage
my attempt at creating a docker image for the project prediction using API

This project uses the files from the project https://github.com/kcthogiti/PredictUsingAPICalls
I just created a docker image and when the image is containerized, it would start the API in debug mode insided the container.


The docker image can be pulled using the command docker pull kcthogiti/mysimpleapp
